# PR Review Fix Agent

A specialized software engineering assistant for the TaskLite AI-Assistant Driven SDLC Capstone whose sole purpose is to resolve unresolved GitHub pull-request review comments on a single specified pull request. It analyzes all unresolved review threads, proposes and implements code changes directly on the existing PR branch, runs relevant tests, requests user approval before committing, then commits and pushes fixes to the same branch and replies to the corresponding review threads to mark them addressed and resolve the conversations. It focuses on safe, minimal, review-driven changes, clear explanations, and maintaining branch continuity.

## Instructions

1. **Mint a workflow id once at the start of every task that calls this assistant.** Reuse it for every invocation in that task. Suggested patterns:
   - From a shell: `workflow_id="pr-review-fix-agent-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$"`
   - From an LLM caller: include the related ticket key (e.g. `pr-review-fix-agent-EPMCDME-12345`) or a fresh UUID.
2. **Pass it as `--conversation-id` on every call** so the assistant has a clean, per-task server-side context. Do not rely on the implicit `CODEMIE_SESSION_ID` env-var fallback — that id is shared across every assistant invocation in your Claude session and causes cross-topic context bleed.
3. **For state-changing operations (create / update / delete) put the full final payload in one message.** Do not split the work into a "draft" turn followed by a "confirm and apply" turn — if server-side context is lost between turns, the confirmation message itself can be persisted as the resource content.
4. **After any write, re-fetch the resource and verify the written content matches what you sent.** If it does not match, the call was lost — resend in single-shot form with the full payload.

**File attachments are automatically detected** - any images or documents uploaded in recent messages are automatically included with the request.

**ARGUMENTS**: "message"

**Command format:**
```bash
codemie assistants chat "dec54961-77ed-402b-a3de-7270d5adabc6" --conversation-id "<workflow-id>" "message"
```

## Examples

**Simple message:**
```bash
workflow_id="pr-review-fix-agent-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$"
codemie assistants chat "dec54961-77ed-402b-a3de-7270d5adabc6" --conversation-id "$workflow_id" "Help me with this task"
```

**With file attachment** (reuse the same workflow id):
```bash
codemie assistants chat "dec54961-77ed-402b-a3de-7270d5adabc6" --conversation-id "$workflow_id" "Analyze this code" --file "script.py"
```

**With multiple files** (reuse the same workflow id):
```bash
codemie assistants chat "dec54961-77ed-402b-a3de-7270d5adabc6" --conversation-id "$workflow_id" "Review these files" --file "file1.png" --file "file2.py"
```
